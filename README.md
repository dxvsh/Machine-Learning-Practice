# Machine Learning Practice

This repository contains my notes from the [Machine Learning Practice](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSCS2008.html) course.

It mostly contains code snippets and examples of various ML techniques implemented using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) like:
+ Regression (Linear, Ridge & Lasso)
+ Classification (Decision Trees, SVM, Naive Bayes, etc)
+ Ensemble Methods (Random Forests, Bagging, Boosting)
+ Clustering (K-Means)

along with examples of using sklearn objects for performing preprocessing like: 
+ Encoders (OneHotEncoder, OrdinalEncoder, etc)
+ Imputers (for imputing missing values)
+ Pipelines (for chaining transformations)
+ Column Transformer
+ Feature Union
+ Feature Selection
