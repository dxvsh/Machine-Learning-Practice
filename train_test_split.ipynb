    "## Train-test Split \n",
    "\n",
    "You can split your dataset into a training set and a test set using the `train_test_split` function from `sklearn`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now train your model with the training set and test it on the unseen test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful parameters of the `train_test_split` function:\n",
    "- `test_size` (float): specify the size of the test set (between 0.0 and 1.0). Eg: 0.2 would reserve 20% of the dataset as the test set and use 80% as training set\n",
    "- `random_state` (int): controls the randomness in the train and test split. Pass an integer for reproducible output across multiple function calls\n",
    "\n",
    "The `random_state` parameter is very important because if you don't use it, the train and test split will be different each time you run the function. To make sure the split remains the same each time, pass an integer value for the random_state. Popular values for the integer seed are 0 and 42 (from Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very important for debugging and reproducibility, you want the train and test split to be the exact same whenever the function is run.\n"
